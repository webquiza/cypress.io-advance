# Lesson 7 - Reading the browser's `localStorage`

In lesson 1, I mentioned that the last searched term is stored in the browser's `localStorage` so that it can be available on the search field in case of a page refresh.

So, would it be possible to test that such a value was correctly stored in the `localStorage`? üí≠

This is possible by integrating **Cypress** with the [`cypress-localstorage-commands`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-localstorage-commands) library. ü§ù

I've written a content called [**How to read the browser's localStorage with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-read-the-browser-s-localstorage-with-cypress-4k60), and I recommend that you read it before moving to the exercise.

## Exercise

Ensure the correct value is stored in the `localStorage` for the `search` key in all search functionality scenarios.

**Note:*** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To save you some time, I've already imported the `cypress-localstorage-commands` library in the [`cypress/support/commands.js`](../cypress/support/commands.js) file.
