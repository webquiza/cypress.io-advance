# Lesson 3 - Testing error scenarios

Now that we're using `cy.intercept()`, we can take advantage of what such a functionality gives us.

Some of these functionalities are 1) it allows us to change the status code of a request's response, and 2) it allows us to force a network failure.

I've written a post about the subject, called [**How to simulate errors with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-simulate-errors-with-cypress-3o3l), and I recommend that you read it before we continue.
Remember, the focus here is on learning, not on finishing the course as fast as possible.

## Exercise

Based on the reading of the recommend content, implement the following pending tests:

* `shows "Something went wrong ..." in case of a server error`
* `shows "Something went wrong ..." in case of a network error`

**Tip:** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I recommend using a totally independent `context` for the tests that simulate errors.

Good job! The coverage is increasing.

Go to [lesson 4](./4.md), and let's ensure the application works end-to-end only for a couple of cases, and for all others, let's test the frontend independent of the **Hacker News** API.
