# Lesson 4 - Testing the frontend independent of the backend

We must have tests that interact with the application end-to-end. However, many other tests could be faster, more independent, and decoupled without losing the guarantee that everything works as expected. In the end, we'll still have some end-to-end tests.

Besides simulating error situations with `cy.intercept()`, we can also mock the API response.

I've written a couple of content about this subject, and I recommend that you read them before we move on.

* [**How to intercept and mock the response of an HTTP request with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-intercept-and-mock-the-response-of-an-http-request-with-cypress-4lc5)
* [**How to use fixtures with Cypress to isolate the frontend tests**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-use-fixtures-with-cypress-to-isolate-the-frontend-tests-2hhl)

## Exercise

First, let's ensure that end-to-end tests cover the following scenarios. This means that for these cases, the app will communicate with the real API.

* `shows 20 stories, then the next 20 after clicking "More"`
* `searches via the last searched term`

Ok, now that we have a couple of end-to-end tests, refactor the following tests to mock the API response.

* `shows only nineteen stories after dimissing the first story` (in this test, you can change it for how many stories as you want, it doesn't necessarily need to be 19)
* `types and hits ENTER`
* `types and clicks the submit button`
* `shows a max of 5 buttons for the last searched terms`

**Tip:** 🧙‍♂️ I recommend separating the tests that interact with the real API from those that mock it on independent contexts.

> For every one of the above tests, I've recorded a video with the solution (i.e., `extra-credit-4-1-1`, `extra-credit-4-1-2`, etc.)

**Curiosity**: _Did you notice the implementation of the `types and hits ENTER` test, where I use ``.type(`${newTerm}{enter}`)`` to type a term and then pressing ENTER? Interesting, isn't it? If you want to know more about it, I've written a content called [**How to type and press ENTER with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-type-and-press-enter-with-cypress-2fl3)_.

Awesome! 🎊 Now that we're mocking the API response for some tests, we can use the same approach to cover the following pending tests.

Implement the following tests:

* `shows the right data for all rendered stories`
* `orders by title`
* `orders by author`
* `orders by comments`
* `orders by points`
* `shows no story when none is returned` (this tests doesn't exist yet, not even as pending. You'll have to implmeent it from scratch)

> For every one of the above tests, I've recorded a video with the solution (i.e., `extra-credit-4-2-1`, `extra-credit-4-2-2`, etc.)

Great job! 👏🏽

Go to [lesson 5](./5.md), and let's refactor the tests a bit more so that we'll make them even more robust, besides following a good practice.
