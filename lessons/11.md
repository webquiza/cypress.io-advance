# The last challenge

Before developing the **Hacker Stories** application, I've developed a similar version (in JavaScript). In this other version, there's a cache implementation for the searched terms, there are no quick search buttons, and the pagination is 100 by 100.

_How would you test that cache is working?_ ðŸ¤”

> Could `cy.intercept()` may help? ðŸ™Š ðŸ˜ƒ

> [This publication](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-intercept-problems/), by Gleb Bahmutov, might help too.

I challenge you to use all the knowledge you learned until here and apply it to this other version of the **Hacker Stories** app.

The app can be found via the following address https://infinite-savannah-93746.herokuapp.com/.

> After you finish it, publish your tests on a public GitHub repository and share them with me. I'm looking forward to seeing what you were able to achieve.
