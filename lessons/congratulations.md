# 🥳 Congratulations, you made it! 🎉

What a journey, ha?

I hope you enjoyed the course as much as I liked teaching it to you.

Let's recap what you've learned.

On the advanced course of Cypress, you learned:

- How to create tests 100% flakiness-free ✔️
- How to interact with web apps as close as real users do ✔️
  - How to wait for an element to be visible before interacting with it ✔️
  - How to test searching functionalities simulating keyboard events ✔️
  - How to wait for an HTTP request to finish before moving on with the tests ✔️
- How to organize tests in their specific contexts ✔️
- How to read the browser's `localStorage` ✔️
- How to make element selectors specific ✔️
- How to simplify repetitive commands ✔️
- How to intercept and mock an external API to test the frontend decoupled from the backend ✔️
- How to simulate server and network failures ✔️
- How to simulate a delay on an API call ✔️
- How to change the default test report to one that fits your style  ✔️

Now, it's time to put all this knowledge into practice.
