# Lesson 2 - Testing the application as a real user

Before we start, I recommend you navigate through the files inside of the [`cypress/`](../cypress/) directory, and the [`cypress.json`](../cypress.json) file to familiarize yourself with the existing codebase.

Now that you're familiarized with the code, we can start improving it!

At the beginning of the test suite, we already have some space for improvement.

I'm referring to the following snippet of code.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('/')

  cy.assertLoadingIsShownAndHidden()
  cy.contains('More').should('be.visible')
})
```

This code "works". However, this is not how a real user behaves when using a searching app. In other words, the user does not wait for a `Loading ...` component to be visible, then not visible, and then for the pagination button to be available.

If we put ourselves in the user's shoes, after visiting the application, we simply wait for it to be in a state where we can search for a term. That's it.

Thinking about that, it would be nice if we could intercept the request that the application makes to the **Hacker News** API, give it an alias, and wait for such a request to finish before moving on.

Lucky we're using [**Cypress**](https://cypress.io) for writing the tests. 🚀

**Cypress** has a functionality called `cy.intercept()`, which can help us **a lot**.

By the way, I've written a blog post named [**How to wait for a request to finish before moving on with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-wait-for-a-request-to-finish-before-moving-on-with-cypress-2030).
I recommend that you read it before moving on. It's better to fix the new knowledge than running without understanding what's going on, right?

For more details on the `cy.intercept()` functionality, I recommend reading the [**official Cypress documentation**](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept.html).

## Exercise

Refactor the block of code of the first `beforeEach` of the test suite so that it waits for a `GET` request to the route `**/search?query=React&page=0` before moving on, instead of waiting for elements to be visible and then not visible.

> 🧙🏻 By the end of your implementation, I recommend running `npm run lint`, which will statically analyze the code to see if the defined coding style is being followed.

> 🧙🏿 When static analysis finds issues, the linter can automatically fix some of them by running `npm run lint:fix`.

> 🧙🏼 After resolving every exercise, remember to run the tests with `npm test` and ensure that they continue to work. You can also use Cypress test runner by running the `npm run cy:open` command.

Once again, refactor the `beforeEach` block of code so that it waits for a `GET` request to the `**/search` pathname, passing the query string `query` and `page` as properties of the `query` object that `cy.intercept()` accepts.

🙊 😃

```js
cy.intercept({
  method: 'GET',
  pathname: '**/search',
  query: {
    query: 'React',
    page: '0'
  }
}).as('getStories')
```

## Extra credit 2

In the following tests, `GET` requests are also being made to the **Hacker News** API, and so, we could wait for such requests to finish before moving on, instead of waiting for elements to be visible or not.

* `shows 20 stories, then the next 20 after clicking "More"`
* `types and hits ENTER`
* `types and clicks the submit button`
* `searches via the last searched term`
* `shows a max of 5 buttons for the last searched terms`

Your mission is to refactor the above tests using one of the previous refactoring approaches so that we are testing the application as close as possible as to how real users use it.

> For every one of the above tests, I've recorded a video with the solution (i.e., `extra-credit-2-1`, `extra-credit-2-2`, etc.)

**Curiosity:** _Did you notice the implementation of the `shows a max of 5 buttons for the last searched terms` test case, where instead of repeating the code to search 6 times, I'm using the `Cypress._.times()` feature, passing as first argument the number `6`, and as the second argument, a function that executes the search? This is called **simplifying repetitive commands**._

## Extra credit 3

Right after the `types and clicks the submit button` test, add a new one called `types and submits the form directly`.

Something like this.

```js
it('types and submits the form directly', () => {
  cy.get('form input[type="text"]')
    .should('be.visible')
    .clear()
    .type('cypress')
  cy.get('form').submit()

  // Assertion here
})
```

I've decided to bring you this extra credit to demonstrate an option for submitting forms with **Cypress**, but I don't recommend using it unless necessary. The point is that this is not how real users interact with the application. Real users have no way to invoke the form submission directly (unless they know some JavaScript and how to use the dev tools. 😜)

**Note:** 🧙🏿 Since we're testing the application from a real user's perspective, delete the just-created tests after their implementation. I just wanted you to know of this possibility.

It's getting better, ha?

Go to [lesson 3](./3.md) to implement some pending tests for error situations.
