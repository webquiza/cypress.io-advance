It's a good practice when writing graphical user interface (GUI) tests to ensure that elements are visible, for instance, before interacting with them (e.g., before a `.type()`, `.clear()`, or `.click()`).

I've written a content called [**How to fill out and submit forms with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-fill-out-and-submit-forms-with-cypress-4fm7), in which I talk about this good practice. I recommend reading this post before moving forward.
