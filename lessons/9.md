# Lesson 9 - Modifying the test report

Congrats on getting here! 👏🏾

This is a silly lesson, and I thought about not even creating it. But I decided to do it anyway because maybe someone else (besides me) could like it too. 😜

I love cats! I have a couple, Alemão and Florinda. 🐾🐾🐾🐾

One day, while researching the [**official Cypress docs**](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters.html), I found out the possibility of altering the default test report that is printed on the terminal.

Then, I found one that prints the following result after running the tests.

```sh
Running:  hackerStories.spec.js                                                           (1 of 1)
 7   -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_,------,
 0   -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_|   /\_/\
 7   -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-^|__( o .o)
     -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-  ""  ""

  7 passing (11s)
  7 pending
```

I loved it, and I thought you could like it too.

## Exercise

On the [`package.json`](../package.json) file, change the `test` script to run `cypress run --reporter nyan` instead of `cypress run`.

Finally, on the terminal (or on the VS Code shortcut), run `npm test` and see the result with this cute kitty that reports how many tests have passed, failed, or how many are still pending.
