# Lesson 8 - Simulating a delay on an API call

When we started our refactoring, there on lesson 2, the first change we made was replacing the verification that the `Loading ...` element was visible and then not visible to verify that the correct request has happened instead.

But what if we wanted to test this intermediate state of the searching functionality?

We could very well have a scenario that would do the same thing that we had on that `beforeEach` function. Something like this.

```js
it('shows a "Loading ..." state before showing the results', () => {
  cy.visit('/')

  cy.assertLoadingIsShownAndHidden()

  cy.get('.item').should('have.length', 20)
})
```

However, what would happen if the request's response happened so quickly that **Cypress** had no time to see if the `Loading ...` element was visible?

In this case, we would have a flaky test.

I wouldn't say I like flaky tests, and I imagine that if you're going through this course, you might not like them too.

> Flaky tests sometimes fail while other times pass, without any code change (on the application or the tests themselves.)

Once again, `cy.intercept()` comes to our rescue. 🦸🏿‍♂️

I've written a content called [**How to simulate the delay in a request with Cypress**](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/how-to-simulate-the-delay-in-a-request-with-cypress-21g4), and I recommend that you read it before moving on with the exercise.

**Note:** 🧙‍♂️ For details about the implementation of the `assertLoadingIsShownAndHidden` custom command, access the [`cypress/support/commands.js`](../cypress/support/commands.js) file.

## Exercise

Write a test scenario called `shows a "Loading ..." state before showing the results`, where you will simulate a delay of one second to ensure the test is robust.

Perfect! 👌

Go to [lesson 9](./9.md) to modify the test report to one that fits better with your style.
