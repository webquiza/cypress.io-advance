# Lesson 6 - Making elements' selectors more specific

Sometimes, we have to use long CSS selectors that identify elements uniquely.

With **Cypress**, we can scope from which element we will select, which helps test legibility.

For example, let's see an element locator from the `shows a max of 5 buttons for the last searched terms` test.

```js
cy.get('.last-searches button')
```

In this case, I'm searching for all buttons contained in an element with the class `last-searches`.

**Note:** I know that this CSS selector is not too long, but I'll use it to make a point and show you another possibility that **Cypress** offers us, in case you face a long CSS selector or one that is unnecessarily complex.

```js
cy.get('.last-searches')
  .within(() => {
    cy.get('button').should(/*...*/)
  })
```

On the above example, first, I scope the element selection to the one with the `last-searches` class, and then, inside of the `.within()` callback function, I use `cy.get()`, to get all buttons that are children of the `last-searches` parent element.

**Note 2:** For more detail on the usage of the `cy.get().within()` functionality, I recommend reading the [**official Cypress docs**](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get.html#Get-in-within).

## Exercise

Refactor the `shows a max of 5 buttons for the last searched terms` using the `cy.get().within()` functionality.
